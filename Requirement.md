## Project Details

### This platform enables merchants to issue 
    virtual cards, fund accounts, 
    and track transactions through a secure, auditable ledger.

### Requirements - Virtual Card Issuance Application
    - Develop and implement merchant onboarding processes, including registration, login, and verification.
    - Design and manage cardholder management features, focusing on basic information such as name and email
    - Create APIs for virtual card issuance, with initial mock bank integration. -
    - Implement wallet funding and balance tracking functionalities.
    - Develop a comprehensive Ledger API to log all transactions, including debits and credits.
    - Implement spending limit validation logic. -
    - Manage transaction processing using event-driven architecture, such as Kafka.

### Key Skills 
    Key Requirements: 
        - Proficiency in Java and Spring Boot. 
        - Experience with modern architecture and event-driven processing. 
        - Familiarity with third-party integrations. 
        - Strong understanding of secure and auditable ledger systems.
    Ideal Skills and Experience: 
        - Experience in backend development for financial or payment systems. 
        - Knowledge of authentication methods, including Email and Password, Two-Factor Authentication, and OAuth.

## SOLUTION DETAILS:
    You're building a foundational fintech platform with a modular architectureâ€”great! Here's a high-level implementation plan broken down by each requirement:
    ________________________________________

### âœ… 1. Merchant Onboarding
    Features:
    â€¢	Registration: Collect name, email, phone, business info
    â€¢	Login: Secure with password (bcrypt) + JWT
    â€¢	Verification: KYC document upload, email/OTP verification
    Stack:
    â€¢	Spring Boot + JPA
    â€¢	PostgreSQL (for user storage)
    â€¢	Spring Security + JWT
    Endpoints:
    POST /api/merchants/register
    POST /api/merchants/login
    GET  /api/merchants/verify-email
    POST /api/merchants/upload-kyc
    ________________________________________

### âœ… 2. Cardholder Management
    Data Model:
    â€¢	Cardholder: id, merchant_id, name, email, status
    Endpoints:
    POST   /api/cardholders
    GET    /api/cardholders/{id}
    PATCH  /api/cardholders/{id}
    ________________________________________

### âœ… 3. Virtual Card Issuance with Mock Bank Integration
    Mock Bank:
    â€¢	Simulate card issuance with REST stub or WireMock
    â€¢	Store: card_number, expiry, cvv, cardholder_id, wallet_id
    Endpoint:
    POST /api/cards/issue
    ________________________________________

### âœ… 4. Wallet Funding & Balance Tracking
    Wallet Table:
    wallet: id, merchant_id, balance, currency, status
    Funding via:
    â€¢	Manual admin load
    â€¢	Simulated payment webhook
    Endpoint:
    POST /api/wallets/fund
    GET  /api/wallets/{walletId}/balance
    ________________________________________

### âœ… 5. Ledger API (Double-entry)
    Schema:
    ledger_entry: id, from_account, to_account, amount, currency, txn_id, type, status, timestamp
    â€¢	Each wallet/card/account is an account in the ledger
    â€¢	Every action creates balanced debit/credit entries
    Endpoint:
    POST /api/ledger/entries
    GET  /api/ledger/txns/{txnId}
    ________________________________________

### âœ… 6. Spending Limit Validation
    â€¢	Limit per cardholder (e.g., per day, per txn)
    â€¢	Enforced via pre-check before processing
    â€¢	Store limits in a limits table:
    limits: cardholder_id, daily_limit, txn_limit, spent_today
    ________________________________________

### âœ… 7. Event-Driven Transaction Processing (Kafka)
    Topics:
    â€¢	txn.funded
    â€¢	txn.spend_requested
    â€¢	txn.spending_validated
    â€¢	ledger.entry_created
    Flow:
    1.	/api/cards/spend â†’ publishes to txn.spend_requested
    2.	A Kafka consumer checks limits and wallet balance
    3.	If valid, creates Ledger entries
    4.	Updates balances, emits txn.completed
    ________________________________________

### ðŸ§  Additional Notes:
    â€¢	Use Outbox pattern for transactional Kafka publishing
    â€¢	Use Spring Cloud Stream or plain spring-kafka
    â€¢	Use Idempotency tokens to prevent double spends
    â€¢	Add Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring transactions & balances
